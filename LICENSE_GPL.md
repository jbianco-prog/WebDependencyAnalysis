## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use this in a commercial environment?
**Yes!** GPL v3 allows commercial use. You can use this software in your business, charge for support, or include it in commercial products. However, if you distribute it (modified or not), you must provide the source code under GPL v3.

### Can I modify the code for internal use?
**Yes!** You can modify the code for internal use without distributing the changes. The GPL only requires you to share modifications if you distribute the software to others.

### Do I need to open-source my entire application if I use this?
Only if the software incorporates this code directly. If you simply use it as a separate tool or script, your application is not affected. However, any modifications to this specific script must remain GPL v3.

### Can I relicense this under a different license?
**No.** As a user, you cannot relicense GPL software. Only the original copyright holder (Micro-one) can change the license. However, you can dual-license your own original contributions if you are the sole author.

### What if I receive this software without source code?
Contact the distributor and request the source code. Under GPL v3, they are legally obligated to provide it. If they refuse, they are in violation of the license.
